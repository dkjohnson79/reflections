1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? When you are collaberating with other people on a project
2)Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? You can check what changes have been made before pulling the directory. If someone changed the code, you don't neccessarily want it in your code until you decide.
